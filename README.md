# Honey API Playground
First of all, thank you for taking a look at this project :)
This is a learning project using Spring Boot to gain a better understanding of this framework and backend development in general.

In a nutshell, this project includes a CRUD system with a simple authentication feature for users.

### Running the Project ‚úÖ
To run this project, you'll need the following tools:

- JDK 11
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- PostgreSQL 14.0+ (Only required for the DEV application profile)

Once you have all the necessary tools installed, simply import the project into your favorite IDE and run ApiplaygroundApplication.
The default application profile is **local**, which uses an **H2 in-memory database**.

### Concepts Learned üìö

Key concepts learned from this project:
- Fundamental Spring Boot concepts
- Development of RESTful CRUD operations
- Backend development
- Authentication and Authorization
- Data validation (DTOs and Domains)
- Establishing relationships between tables using Spring Data JPA (1-1, 1-n, n-n)
- Layered architecture
- Microservices
- Unit testing (Controllers, Services, Repositories)
- Use of mocks in unit tests (Mockito)
- AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)
- Applying AOP with AspectJ and Spring Boot

### Technologies and Tools üõ†Ô∏è
